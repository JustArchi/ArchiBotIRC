[-- Icon Description: --]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metrox is a complete system set currently containing over 90 icons in 32x32 and
16x16 sizes.

The overall look has a solid and chunky feel in a bold 3D style.

Because of their neutral colour & bold styling they tend to suit nearly all
desktop themes and colour schemes. This version is the original black & white
edition, however I will also be releasing various re-coloured sets of the Metrox
icons in the future.

The main inspiration has been taken from a certain 'Japanese-style' of icon design
that uses bold borders and chunky looking icons - I have taken this concept and
evolved it into a complete system set using a combination of 2D and 3D design work.
