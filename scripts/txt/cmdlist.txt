[q_autolimit]
———› Description:

Usage: /msg Q AUTOLIMIT <channel> [<threshold>]

The autolimit feature maintains a user limit (+l) on the channel which is regularly updated to keep a fixed number of spaces free on the channel for people to join. This is useful since it prevents a large number of "clones" joining at the same time. However, if the number of free spaces is too small it's possible that legitimate users won't be able to join. This command allows you to adjust the number of free spaces to maintain when autolimit is enabled.
To actually turn the autolimit feature on or off, see CHANFLAGS. Where:
channel - the channel to use.

Viewing the current flags requires operator (+o) access on the named channel.
Changing the flags requires master (+m) access on the named channel.
Valid channel flags are:
+a AUTOOP Automatically ops any user who has op access when they join the channel. Same effect as giving all ops the +a chanlev flag.
+b BITCH Prevents users who don't have operator access on the channel from being opped (automatically deops them)
+c AUTOLIMIT Enables automatic limit feature - updates the channel limit at regular intervals to keep a certain number of free spaces. This can mitigate the effect of join floods. See AUTOLIMIT.
+e ENFORCE Enforces bans on the channel. Any user who is banned will be kicked automatically.

[q_chanlev]
———› Description:
Shows or modifies user access on a channel.

channel - the channel to use
user - the user to list or modify. user can be specified as either an active nickname on the network or #accountname. If user is not specified then all known users are listed.
change - lists the flags to add or remove, with + to add or - to remove. For example, +ao to add a and o flags, or -gv to remove g and v flags. This can be used to add or remove users from the channel. If change is not specified then the current access of the named user is displayed.
Displaying known user information requires you to be known (+k) on the named channel.
Adjusting flags for other users requires master (+m) access on the named channel.
Adding or removing the +m flag for other users requires owner (+n) access on the named channel.
You may always remove your own flags, except +qdb flags (which are not visible to you).
Adding or removing personal flags requires you to be known (+k) on the named channel.
Note that channel owners (+n) can grant +n to channel masters but they must use the GIVEOWNER command for this.
The access level flags determine which commands a user is allowed to use on a channel.
Holding an access flag also grants access to any action requiring a lesser flag (e.g. +m users can perform actions requiring operator (+o) status even if they do not actually have +o set). The access flags are listed in descending order.
Valid flags are:
Access level flags - these control the user's overall privilege level on the channel:
+n OWNER Can add or remove masters and all other flags (except personal flags)
+m MASTER Can add or remove all access except master or owner
+o OP Can get ops on the channel
+v VOICE Can get voice on the channel
+k KNOWN Known on the channel - can get invites to the channel via INVITE
Punishment flags - these restrict the user on the channel in some way:
+q DEVOICE Not allowed to be voiced on the channel
+d DEOP Not allowed to be opped on the channel
+b BANNED Banned from the channel
Extra flags - these control specific behaviour on the channel:
+a AUTOOP Ops the user automatically when they join the channel (the user must also hold +o in order to have this flag)
+g AUTOVOICE Voices the user automatically when they join the channel (the user must also hold +v in order to have this flag)
+p PROTECT If the user has +o or +v, this makes sure they will always have that status, they will be reopped/voiced if deopped/voiced
+t TOPIC Can use SETTOPIC to alter the topic on the channel
Personal flags - these control user personal preferences and can only be changed by the user concerned. They are not visible to other users.
+w NOWELCOME Prevents the welcome message being sent when you join the channel.
+j AUTOINV Invites you to the channel automatically when you authenticate.
Note that non-sensible combinations of flags are not allowed. After making a change the current status of the named user on the channel will be confirmed.
[q_chanmode]

channel - the channel to use
modes - the list of modes to allow or deny. Modes specified with + will be enforced on the channel at all times, those specified with - will not be allowed on the channel. If modes are not specified the current setting will be displayed. If +k or +l modes are included, the actual key or limit to be enforced must also be specified, for example "-il+ntk mykey", or "+nstl-Cc 20". If you do not want any modes enforced, "CHANMODE <channel> none" will clear the list.
Viewing the enforced modes requires operator (+o) access on the named channel.
Updating the enforced modes requires master (+m) access on the named channel.
Note: unlike similar commands that work on flags, specifying modes REPLACES the list of modes to be enforced rather than changing the existing list. This is because - modes are valid as well as + modes. Thus whenever you specify the modes argument you must provide the complete list of desired modes each time.
Note: if autolimit is enabled (see CHANFLAGS) it will cause a +l limit mode to be enforced, with the value updating periodically as users join and leave.
This +l forcing cannot be changed or overridden without disabling the autolimit function using the CHANFLAGS command.

source must be a full qualified nickname or channel.
Date always has to be the format mm-dd-yy.
Time always has to be hh:mm:ss.

you will get the last log entrys since you played PLAYTRAFFICLOG last the last time or you deleted the log (see ERASETRAFFICLOG).
Some hints about logging:
- you should filter loggings, or possibly would get an extensive amount of diskspace usage. If you got a quota on your shell, you should use this functionality with maximum care or possibly run out of diskspace fast.
- logging only will happen if you are NOT connected to the bouncer.
- if you define * as filter, anything that happens to the source will be logged.
- you need to care about erasing the traffic log. That happens using ERASETRAFFICLOG. It will erase the whole logfile and start a new one.
