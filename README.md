About the bot
Initially made for NS2 Finland community, the bot has now gained more widespread usage. Over 100 gathers have been played on it during the 3 month period it's been in development. 

The bot's messages are now localized, English and Finnish are available. The language can be changed easily at run-time.

If you're interested to run this bot on your channel and want advice/help, drop me a message at IRC (jukkan@Qnet) or gmail (jukka.hopea).

<font face="Candara"><h3>What is it?</h3></font>
My attempt to make a configurable IRC-bot that manages pickups/gather 
matches. It's written in perl programming language and uses the Bot::BasicBot module as 
a base library. It's under active development as of February 2013.
