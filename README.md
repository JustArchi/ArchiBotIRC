=========

A configurable IRC-bot for managing gathers/pickups


What is it?
My attempt to make a configurable IRC-bot that manages pickups/gather 
matches. It's written in perl programming language and uses the Bot::BasicBot module as 
a base library. It's under active development as of February 2013.

Needed to run
perl, perl modules Bot::BasicBot and DateTime (at least) -to be complemented later-

About the bot
Initially made for NS2 Finland community, the bot has now gained more widespread usage. Over 100 gathers have been played on it during the 3 month period it's been in development. 

The bot's messages are now localized, English and Finnish are available. The language can be changed easily at run-time.

If you're interested to run this bot on your channel and want advice/help, drop me a message at IRC (jukkan@Qnet) or gmail (jukka.hopea).
