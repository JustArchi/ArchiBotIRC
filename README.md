<font face="Candara"><h3>What is it?</h3></font>
<p>My attempt to make a configurable IRC-bot that manages pickups/gather matches. It's written in perl programming language and uses the Bot::BasicBot module as a base library. It's under active development as of February 2013.<p>

<font face="Candara"><h3>Needed to run</h3></font>
perl<br>
perl modules: Bot::BasicBot, DateTime (at least, to be complemented later)

<font face="Candara"><h3>About the bot</h3></font>
<p>Initially made for the NS2 Finland community, the bot is now gaining more widespread usage. Over 100 gathers have been played on it during the 3 month period it's been in development.</p>
<p>The bot's messages are now localized, English and Finnish are available. The language can be changed easily at run-time.</p>
<p>If you're interested to run this bot on your channel and want advice/help, drop me a message (contact info is at the top).</p>
